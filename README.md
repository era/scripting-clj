This repository contains different scripts to make my life easier. Each folder represents a category, for example the folder git has clojure scripts to handle github and codeberg.

- new-project.cljs: setups a new project by creating a folder, initing git and creating a repo on Codeberg and Github. Also adds both urls as push url (but uses only github as pull).
